# Code Refactor SEO

## Description

A refactor project of an existing webpage including html and external .css file.

- I wanted to simplify and clean up the html and fix several issues within the original code while replacing several tags with semantic counterparts.
- I wanted to consolidate the style.css file and comment which part was doing what to the finished webpage.
- I also fixed an issue with a header link not properly jumping to its counterpart further down the webpage.
- While altering the style.css file I realized I could combine multiple selectors into one section, saving a bit of space and making the file much easier to read.

You can hover your mouse over one of the three sections on the right side of the header to see that they are links. You can then click on one of the three sections to jump to the corresponding section of the webpage.
